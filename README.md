### Description

This program, which loads in to the system tray, allows you to put 'post-it notes' on your desktop to remind you about stuff you have got to do. Features a date/time function for a Sticky Note to pop up and remind you what you wrote in it. Can be minimised and hidden, or minimised to the task bar depending on what you select. I use this program because I can never find enough space for more post-it notes as my screen becomes surrounded by yellow paper! :o)
